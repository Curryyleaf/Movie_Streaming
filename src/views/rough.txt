Sure! Let's break down how the functionality will execute step by step in the provided code using `v-show`.

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Initialization (Mounted Hook)**:
   - When the component is mounted, the `mounted` lifecycle hook is called.
   - The `currentImage` is set to the first image in the `images` array.
   - The `preloadImage` method is called to preload the first image.
   - The `startAutoTransition` method is invoked, which sets up an interval to change the image every 3 seconds.

2. **Preloading the First Image**:
   - The `preloadImage` function creates a new `Image` object and sets its `src` to the first image URL.
   - This ensures the image is loaded in the background and is ready to be displayed without delay.

3. **Interval for Changing Images**:
   - The `setInterval` function in `startAutoTransition` triggers every 3 seconds.
   - Each time it runs, the `changeImage` method is called.

4. **Changing Images**:
   - In `changeImage`, the `currentIndex` is updated to the next index in the `images` array, wrapping around when it reaches the end.
   - The `nextImage` variable is set to the new image based on the updated index.
   - The `preloadImage` function is called again to preload the next image.

5. **Loading the Next Image**:
   - The `@load` event listener on the `nextImage` triggers the `onNextImageLoad` method once the next image finishes loading.
   - This method sets `currentImage` to `nextImage`, making it visible (`v-show` will display it).
   - `nextImage` is then cleared to prepare for the next cycle.

6. **Image Transition**:
   - Because both `currentImage` and `nextImage` are in the DOM and managed by `v-show`, the browser handles the visibility changes.
   - The CSS class with the transition effects applies a fade effect when changing images, creating a smooth transition as `currentImage` becomes visible and `nextImage` fades out.

7. **Stopping the Interval**:
   - If the component is destroyed (e.g., navigating away), the `beforeDestroy` lifecycle hook is triggered.
   - The `stopAutoTransition` method is called, clearing the interval and stopping the image changes.

### Chronological Flow
1. **Component Mounts**
   - Initialize `currentImage` to the first image.
   - Preload the first image.
   - Start the interval to change images every 3 seconds.

2. **Every 3 Seconds**
   - Change to the next image by updating `currentIndex` and setting `nextImage`.
   - Preload the new `nextImage`.

3. **When `nextImage` Loads**
   - Update `currentImage` to `nextImage` (making it visible).
   - Clear `nextImage`.

4. **Component Unmounts**
   - Clear the interval to stop image changes.

### Summary
This setup ensures that:
- Images load smoothly with minimal flickering.
- The transition is visually appealing.
- Performance is optimized by keeping the elements in the DOM.
